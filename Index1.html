<h1> Poject Intoduction </h1>

<h2>1. Problem Space and Findings from the White Paper</h2>

<h3>Problem Space:</h3>
<p>Amravati City is undergoing significant urban expansion, leading to increased pressure on its transit infrastructure. Problems include station overcrowding, inefficient route planning, inadequate tourist guidance, and a lack of user-friendly digital platforms. These issues affect daily commuters, tourists, and emergency response during peak hours.</p>

<h3>How It Was Identified:</h3>
<p>Through a white paper analysis, we assessed city-wide transit challenges and user feedback. Surveys and real-time data from transit systems revealed bottlenecks in connectivity, delays, and accessibility issues.</p>

<h3>Key Findings from White Paper:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Station overcrowding is prevalent during peak hours, causing delays and discomfort.</li>
    <li>Lack of efficient route planning tools affects commuters and tourists.</li>
    <li>Users need a platform to search, filter, and sort transit options effectively.</li>
    <li>There is minimal use of technology to manage crowd flow and provide real-time updates.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reflection on City Design:</h3>
<p>Amravati’s transit design, though comprehensive, lacks integration with smart city principles. A focus on incorporating modern algorithms and real-time data can transform the transit system to meet growing demands.</p>

<h3>Business Case Identification:</h3>
<p>Business cases were derived by analyzing the pain points of different user groups (commuters, tourists, and authorities). Each issue was translated into actionable problems, which formed the basis for the project’s case studies.</p>

<h2>2. Problem Definition and Team Details</h2>

<h3>Problem Definition:</h3>
<p> The Smart Transit System for Amravati City aims to address critical challenges in urban mobility by optimizing transit operations and improving user experience. This includes providing efficient station management, real-time route planning, dynamic crowd control, and user-friendly navigation tools for both commuters and tourists. The system leverages advanced algorithms and data structures to deliver seamless, accessible, and smart transit solutions tailored to the city's growing needs. </p>

<h3>Team Details:</h3>

<h2>3. Business Cases for Each Member </h2>

<h3>Business Cases:</h3>

<h4>Displaying All Stations of the City:</h4>
<p><strong>Member:</strong>  Shakti prasad <br>
Description: Use BFS and DFS graph traversal techniques to list and visualize all stations. This feature ensures that commuters and planners have a comprehensive view of the city's transit nodes.</p>

<h4>Search and Filter Stations:</h4>
<p><strong>Member:</strong> Bandu Ramesh chavan <br>
Description: Develop a platform for users to search and filter stations based on proximity, accessibility, or connectivity. Sorting is achieved through heap sort, enabling users to prioritize options quickly.</p>

<h4>Dynamic Route Suggestions:</h4>
<p><strong>Member:</strong>  Vijay kumar <br>
Description: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two stations. This feature dynamically adjusts routes based on congestion and delays, providing real-time updates to commuters.</p>

<h4>Real-Time Crowd Management:</h4>
<p><strong>Member:</strong> Madhav N <br>
Description: Create a system that monitors station crowd levels and alerts passengers. By distributing passengers during peak hours, the system ensures smoother transit flow.</p>

<h4>Tourist-Friendly Route Guide:</h4>
<p><strong>Member:</strong> Madhav N <br>
Description: Use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to suggest optimal routes for tourists unfamiliar with the city’s transit system. This tool will provide comprehensive guidance, including transit times and connectivity.</p>
